# E-commerce Inventory Application

This project is a simple **e-commerce inventory management** backend built with **Python Flask**. It showcases how to develop, containerize, and deploy a real-world web service using modern cloud-native tools.

### What This Project Does

- Implements a RESTful API for managing product inventory with Flask.
- Containerizes the application using Docker for easy deployment.
- Demonstrates deploying the containerized app on a local Kubernetes cluster with Minikube.
- Includes Kubernetes manifests for Deployment and Service to manage and expose the app.
- Provides a hands-on example to learn how development and production environments connect through containerization and orchestration.

This project is perfect for developers and platform engineers looking to build practical skills in Docker and Kubernetes while working with a real-world application.
